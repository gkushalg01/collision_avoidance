# collision_avoidance
This repo contains the code I came across while researching on collision avoidance. 


Firsly I camer acrros a pretty cool algorithm but realised that it was specific to drones. As it depended on free movment of robots in any direction.  
In my case, however, the robots are warehouse robots which have restricted movement, restricted upto the instructed path.
So ultimately, I had to scrape that algorithm and totally devise something of my own.
It required 1 month but I made a good rnough system for collision avoidance using simple concepts of geometry and multiple conditions condensed into two statements. It is not possible to condense it in a readme as the actual documentation is of many pages.
